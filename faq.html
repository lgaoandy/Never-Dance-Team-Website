                <p class="faq-answer">We mainly practice at the YMCA in Eau Claire, or the Central Library.</p><br>

                <p class="faq-answer">In the summer, we may have more practice times in the week depending on member availability.</p><br>

                <label class="faq-question"><i>Q</i>: How do covers work?</label>
                <p class="faq-answer">Covers are broken down to 4 practices days and 1 filming day.<br>
                    During practice, we primarily focus on positions and getting everyone in sync. 
                    Throughout the project, the group will decide on filming locations and outfits.
                </p><br>

                <label class="faq-question"><i>Q</i>: Are there any expectations or responsibilities for a member?</label>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Once selected into a cover, you are expected to learn sections of the dance in your own time
                    ahead of practice.
                </p><br>

                <label class="faq-question"><i>Q</i>: How do we pick what songs to cover?</label>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Song selection is predominantly based upon what our members want to cover. 
                    When the amount of members interested matches the number requirement, it can become a cover.
                </p><br>

                <label class="faq-question"><i>Q</i>: Are there are live performance opportunities?</label>

                    Every year during summer, we will compete in the SSK korean competition in Calgary.

                <label class="faq-question"><i>Q</i>: What happens when I get accepted?</label>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    You will be given the opportunity to join us on a cover for a trial period.
                    During this time, our manager will assess your commitment, skills and 
                    how you interact with the rest of the group. 
                    Once you pass the assessment, you will be officially accepted as a member 
                    and you will be added to our Facebook group page where all important information 
                    about cover projects and practices will be, as well as our facebook messenger group chat.
